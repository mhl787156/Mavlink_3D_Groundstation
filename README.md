# 3D Mavlink Groundstation

This project attempts to use three.js and mapbox to create a basic 3D groundstation

## Usage

This uses mapbox. You will need to create a mapbox account and create an access token.

You will then either need to either set the environment variable `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` or use create a `.env` file inside gcs_app with the following:

```bash
MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token_here
```
